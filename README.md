## Project Introduction

Tenon is a comprehensive development framework based on the .NET Core platform, designed to accelerate the development process and enhance efficiency by integrating key technologies in modern software development. It includes encapsulated features such as message queuing (RabbitMQ), caching (Redis), distributed ID generation (Snowflake), distributed locks (Redis), database repository patterns (EntityFrameworkCore), gateway (Ocelot), service governance (Consul), and ASP.NET Core authentication and authorization. The modular design of these features allows developers to quickly build applications, focusing on business logic without having to construct each component from scratch.

## Core Features

- **Message Queue (RabbitMQ)**: Provides efficient and reliable asynchronous communication capabilities for the system.
- **Caching (Redis)**: Offers fast data access to optimize performance and response times.
- **Distributed ID (Snowflake)**: Generates unique identifiers suitable for resources in distributed systems.
- **Distributed Locks (Redis)**: Ensures synchronized access to resources in a distributed environment and consistency.
- **Database Repository (EntityFrameworkCore)**: Simplifies data layer operations, enhancing code maintainability.
- **Gateway (Ocelot)**: Manages routing in a microservices architecture, enabling API aggregation.
- **Service Governance (Consul)**: Provides service discovery and configuration to ensure service reliability and resilience.
- **Authentication and Authorization (ASP.NET Core)**: Implements secure user access control.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Install necessary dependency services, such as RabbitMQ, Redis, and Consul.
3. Explore the example code in the `Templates` folder to understand how to use the framework.
4. Integrate the required modules according to project needs and start developing.
